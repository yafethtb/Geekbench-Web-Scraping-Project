# Geekbench-Web-Scraping-Project
A web scraping project to extract benchmarking data from GeekBench.com

# About this project
I create this project out of curiosity about benchmarking of CPU in the market. I've tried to search data from some benchmarking sites, but GeekBench is the only one (at least until the time I made this project) that provide name of CPU and their benchmark data openly AND with their HTML codes not shielded by JavaScript. Well, this is my first ever web scraping project. So understandably I only use requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, in order to scrape the static web content from Geekbench.

# The Scope
For this project I tried to scrape data for AMD Ryzen series only. Why AMD? Well, I have no any particular reasons, actually. I choose it because Ryzens are quite new and they're not as many as Intel... or at least that's what I assume. I'm not limiting myself for any other CPU types. Maybe after I collect data from all Ryzen product, I'll try to scrape Intel product too.
